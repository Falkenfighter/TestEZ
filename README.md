# TestEZ
A simple testing framework

The thought behind TestEZ is to provide a minimalist testing framework that is able to handle both unit testing (atomic) and feature/integration testing (dependent).

A lot of the current and planned features are derived from both JUnit and TestNG. The goal is to build upon the success of both of these great frameworks and provide a simpler testing experience.

I have a lot more work to put into this but for a quick example of where this framework is headed take a look at the unit tests.
